#  Notes

# Cant put 2 html or jsx elements next to each other inside the return statement but rather wrap it inside of an empty element(fragement)
# react saves states and rerenders when something changes
# set a unique key to make sure react doesnt reder the same values again and again
# localstorage to save to make sure data shows up everytime you refresh(useEffect)

#  Commands

# Check for node version - 'node -v'
# create react app - 'npx create-react-app .'
# start development environment - 'npm start'
# build app - 'npm run build'
# to take userInput - 'useRef'
# random number create - 'uuid'
